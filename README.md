#Python pattern Programs...

Patterns can be printed in python using simple for loops. 
First outer loop is used to handle the number of rows and the Inner nested loop is used to handle the number of columns. 
Manipulating the print statements, different number patterns, alphabet patterns, or star patterns can be printed.
